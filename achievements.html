    <h3>#1 HE HELPED BUILD INDIA’S FIRST INDIGENOUS HOVERCRAFT
        Abdul Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), right after graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960. As a young scientist, he was assigned his first project to design and develop a hovercraft for the country’s defence applications. A hovercraft is an amphibious craft capable of travelling over land, water, mud, ice and other surfaces. After days of hard-work, Kalam and his team were successful in developing India’s first indigenous hovercraft which was named Nandi, the impressive white bull who acts as the vehicle of the Hindu deity Lord Shiva. Project Nandi received massive applause from the then Defense Minister, V.K Krishna Menon, and encouraged Kalam for his future endeavours. However, Project Nandi was shelved as the new government in power didn’t show any interest in the invention.

        <h4>#2 HE WAS PART OF THE TEAM WHICH SET UP TERLS
            Though Project Nandi was put in cold storage, due to it Kalam got a call from the Indian Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) to attend an interview at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). At the time, INCOSPAR was formed out of the TIFR talent pool. Among the members of the selection panel who interviewed Kalam was Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, the father of the Indian Space Programme and the founder of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Dr. Sarabhai took a deep interest in Kalam and selected him as a rocket engineer in INCOSPAR. The team of rocket engineers of which Kalam was a part, set up the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in 1963. TERLS is used by ISRO to launch sounding rockets even today.</h4>
            <h4>#3 KALAM WAS THE PROJECT DIRECTOR OF INDIA’S FIRST SLV
                In 1969, when INCOSPAR led to the birth of the ISRO, Kalam was transferred there and was initially involved in research about building rockets. In the early 1970s, ISRO introduced its own Satellite Launch Vehicle program owing to geopolitical and economic considerations. It was a program to develop the technology needed to launch satellites. Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was made the project director of the program. Beginning with mechanical designing to electrical integration, Kalam single-handedly supervised every aspect of the project, which was a massive success. On July 18, 1980, Satellite Launch Vehicle-3 (SLV-3) was successfully launched from Sriharikota range in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh. It deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit. It was the first successful satellite launch that took place on Indian soil and thereby made India the seventh member of an exclusive club of space-faring nations in international society.</h4>

                <h4>#4 HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF AGNI AND PRITHVI MISSILES
                    After the huge triumph of SLV-III and dedicating the paramount years of his life to ISRO, Dr. Kalam was issued transfer orders to DRDO, where he was given the responsibility to lead the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP). According to the instructions of then Defence Minister R. Venkataraman, four missiles were to be developed simultaneously as part of the program. After years of consistent hard work and immense dedication, India got her first range of ballistic missiles, the Prithvi, the Agni, the Aakash, and the Nag. Out of the four, two missiles, namely, Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile; and Agni, an intermediate-range ballistic missile; were launched successfully. Due to this mammoth achievement under his leadership, India became a major military power and Dr Kalam became popularly known as the “Missile Man of India”.

                    <h4>#5 DR KALAM SUPERVISED THE POKHRAN-II EXPLOSIONS AS THE CHIEF OF DRDO
                        Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period and Kalam played an intensive political and technological role in their success. Along with Dr. R. Chidambaram, the Director of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), he served as the chief coordinator in the planning of the tests. The Pokhran-II tests, a series of five nuclear bomb test explosions, were conducted at the Indian Army’s Pokhran Test Range in May 1998. The tests achieved their main objective of giving India the capability to build fission and thermonuclear weapons with yields up to 200 Kilotons. Exclusive media coverage during the event, made Kalam a household name in India and he became the best known nuclear scientist in the nation.
